What is this?
Simple but powerful asterisk AMI monitor:
    two threads: one for capturing AMI, other for processing it
    possible to easily hook a callback to any desired AMI event (eg. "Up", newstate "Ringing"...)
    Logs all received AMI to log/ folder.

Currently it sets channel variable JACK_HOOK upon new channel creation (for leg B), so ports can be connected in one more way (dialplan, cli and now AMI).
However, connecting the ports from AMI currently segfaults asterisk, bug report here:

Hope you enjoy it and AMI processing will be much more simple because of this script :-)
